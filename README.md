# Beats Per Minute Sensor

Welcome to the Beats Per Minute (BPM) Sensor project! This project involves the creation of a sensor module that measures and displays the user's heart rate. It was developed as part of the BSc Computer Science course during the first year. The main components used in this project are the pulse sensor, Arduino UNO, OLED display, jumper wires, and a breadboard.

## Features

- Heart Rate Measurement: The BPM sensor module accurately measures the user's heart rate by detecting pulse variations.

- Real-Time Display: The OLED display provides real-time visual feedback of the user's heart rate, allowing for instant monitoring.

## Components Used

The following components were used in the BPM Sensor project:

- Pulse Sensor: This sensor detects the user's pulse variations and provides the heart rate data to the Arduino UNO.

- Arduino UNO: It serves as the main controller for processing the pulse sensor data and driving the OLED display.

- OLED Display: The display unit shows the user's heart rate in beats per minute.

- Jumper Wires: These wires are used to establish connections between the various components of the circuit.

- Breadboard: The breadboard provides a convenient platform for prototyping and connecting the components.



To set up the BPM Sensor project, follow these steps:

1. Connect the pulse sensor to the Arduino UNO using jumper wires. Refer to the sensor's documentation for the pin connections.

2. Connect the OLED display to the Arduino UNO using jumper wires. Again, consult the display's documentation for the pin connections.

3. Set up the circuit on the breadboard, ensuring that all connections are secure.

4. Upload the required code to the Arduino UNO using the Arduino IDE or
